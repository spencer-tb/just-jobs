# Just Jobs (WIP)

A React/Next.js/Typescript/Pocketbase front-end jobs board template.

## What is this project?

This is a project resurface I initially worked on privately in 2022. This acts as an open-source front-end for those who wish to create a simple jobs board using Pocketbase as a back-end.

The aim is to create a generalized job board pipeline where developers can simply define the type of job board they want to create within a config file, such that the rest is magic.

A key part of the project is the back-end jobs scraper that uses SERP to find jobs from public ATS job listings. This will be released in a separate repo once the front-end is hacked and squeeky clean.

## Note

This is a now side project just for fun. I started it initially to find a fully remote job within the crypto space privately. At the time I found that most job boards were not collecting quality job posts that could otherwise be found from ATS sources. I did eventually find get my dream position at the Ethereum Foundation so development on this project stopped.

Now that the project is resurfaced, I would like to make it easier for people to find jobs within the ethereum ecosystem, as well as other technologies I am passionate about.

Types of job boards planned to deploy:

- Ethereum ecosystem specific (I just <3 ETH),
- Web3 specific, better than: [web3.career](https://web3.career),
- AI specific, better than: [ai-jobs.net](https://ai-jobs.net/)
- Data Analyst/Science specific. High traffic, easiest to rank for SEO.

Data is the worlds new oil. Block space the new land where oil resides. AI agents the new governors of our infinite landmass. d/acc-ing the overlap of these 3 technologies, for me is of utmost importance for the future of humanity in the digital age.
